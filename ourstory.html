            <h3>How We Met</h3>
            <p>
                Barsha, do you remember that chance encounter? It wasn't some grand love     story setup, but from that first exchange, there was a spark. Our conversations flowed effortlessly, like we'd known each other for ages.  A lightness touched my heart each time your name popped up on my screen.

                </br>
                That first call sealed the deal. Your voice was a gentle melody, full of warmth and a quiet sparkle that instantly drew me in. And even with those mysterious six days of silence (was that your master plan?!), I just couldn't shake the feeling I'd found someone special.
                </br>
                </br>
                The thing is, Barsha, what I love most isn't about big moments or grand gestures. It's the effortless way we connect,  the quiet joy of just being ourselves with each other. In a world that sometimes feels too serious, your laughter and lighthearted spirit are my safe haven. You found this sometimes-awkward guy on a random website and turned it into the sweetest, most genuine love story I could imagine.

            <h3>Favorite Memories</h3>
            <p>
                Our story isn't the stuff of cheesy movies. It began with chats full of inside jokes, shared silliness, and that quiet excitement whenever I saw your message.  But nothing – nothing – could prepare me for actually meeting you in Ahmedabad. That first hug was like coming home, like I finally found a place where I completely belonged. And that first kiss? Pure magic, Barsha, the kind that left me breathless and grinning like a total goofball.

                Remember that "Animal" movie night? Honestly, the movie was forgettable, but not the biryani, your adorable laugh, and the way you just felt right next to me.   All our pictures, even the ridiculous ones, are precious to me. They show the happiness we create together, and that reminds me every day how lucky I am.
                </br></br>
                The best part about us, Barsha, is that it always feels easy. Even when the world is hectic, being with you makes everything better. I've never felt like this before, and honestly, I never even knew I wanted this kind of love. But now that I have it with you, I'll treasure it forever.</p>
